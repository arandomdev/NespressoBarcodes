# Nespresso Vertuo Barcode Generator
This project aims to decode and generate printable barcodes for the Nespresso's Vertuoline machines. Of course the barcodes aren't guaranteed to work, and i'm not responsible for any broken machines. Though I can't fathom how you could possibly break one.

## Setup
1. Download the latest version of python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Or at least have version 3.7 or greater.
2. Install Pillow through `pip install Pillow`
